                <p>The logical question is where I got money from, as such ocasional decisions are quite expensive, especially during holiday season. My answer is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing target="_blank">Couchsurfing</a>! (CS)</p>

                    <p>This city wasn't in my list, but Yacine proposed me his place for a night. I'll name Lyon fabulous! The architecture is incredible and I was wandering with open mouth.</p>

                    <p>About Marseille from my notes: actually crazy city (haha, baby, you hadn't seen Naples)</p>
                    <p align="center">"yoga practicing, learning about human being, first CS hangout, developing salsa skills, talking about working underwater in Marseille"</p>
                    <p>First problems also appeared in Marseille as I had no host for the second night, which wasn't planned, so..</p>
                    <p align="center">"...she spontaneously joined us after for salsa night without even having a place to stay and she was able to just let go and enjoy herself, very impressed of her positivity..."</p>

                    <h3 class="months">Nice</h3>
                    <p class="drop-cap">I spent there 2 days, first one was just a beach day with Yass. He joined me spontaneously: "He asked me about tomorrow plans, got an answer "Nice" and suggested doing it together".</p>
                    <p>In the evening I found a host, as the planned one canceled on me (I was happy about this, will find the reason later). My morning in Nice started with a cup of coffee and a motorbike ride to hidden beaches. The sea there has an amazing azure color and, despite Jean was against this theory, I'm sure that the name of this region came from the sea's color.</p>
                    <p>I spent the whole afternoon exploring the city and visited Chagal museum. After we met up with Jean again and finished this day talking about everything and anything at the same time with a spectacular view over sunset Nice drinking a bit. Such a cozy atmosphere :)</p>

                    <h3 class="months">Genoa</h3>
                    <p class="drop-cap">I spent in Genoa only 17 hours and had thought that all time will stay at the beach as the air in the city is much drier than in France.</p>
                    <p>But I put "available" in hang out section and found Luigi who wanted to make a moto trip and swim. My backpack (oh, I forgot to mention that for this month took only a backpack, not realy big, to be honest..) was left at his place.</p>
                    <p>Lui took me to a extremely hidden rock "beach" where we got by yacht. After light dinner went to explore night city.</p>
                    <p>My story in Genoa ended at 4 a.m. staying at the bus station holding fresh <i>focacha</i> and hating Italian FlixBus as it was an hour and half late.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="months">Milan</h3>
                    <p class="drop-cap">Arrived in the morning, wanted only shower and to leave my stuff. My host lived in suburbs and the ticket is OVERpriced (come on, 2,20 per ride, wtf, it's 1,5 cup of pretty nice italian capuccino!), so I <i>stole</i> half of all my <i>rides</i> in this city.</p>
                    <p>After shower I spent the whole day out, from one sight to another, from one gallery to another. Milan is absolutely gorgeous.</p>
                    <p>My host was very cute and provided me with a dinner when I came back. We were talking a lot and drinking tasty wine (it's unquestionably true that by refusing wine in Italy you will offend the owner, at least a little, but you need to drink)</p>

                    <h3 class="months">Como</h3>
                    <p class="drop-cap">To be in Milan and don't visit Como is a crime! I was about to give up this idea, but told myself "Veronika, you're strong enough".</p>
                    <p>I didn't have any expectations, so came there for a few hours, ticked place, made a photoset on a lake shore and that's it, happy enough.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="months">Florence</h3>
                    <p class="drop-cap"> Thank you so much Italian FlixBus for being so punctual! (write please essay about punctuality) As you've already understood it was late. And they don't change timetable, so you're staying as a fool and wondering when and will this bus come at all!</p>
                    <p>In Florence I wanted only food and to rest a bit. Bought jogurt, bread, some cheese and ham, had no power even to romanticize life (it's a vibe, imagine how done I was!), so ate on a bench.</p>
                    <p>Then was a looooooong queue to the cathedral, where I got a sunstroke (there was hot as in my worst nightmare), slept at the table leaning against the wall. After 40 mins I put available on hang outs, drank a coffee with one Csurfer and left my backpack in storage room, met another Csurfer to grab some ice cream and spritz.</p>
                    <p>My host in Florence was really nice, emergency doctor, who visited Ukraine in war period and was interested to learn more words (of course, I provide such lessons during my travels to let people know more about my home place, culture and history) and shared his dinner with me.</p>
                    <p>On a second day there I visited famous Uffizi Gallery and in the evening was invited to roof party with breathtaking view.</p>

                <h3 class="months">Rome</h3>
                <p class="drop-cap">I'd already been there 4,5 years ago, but wanted to come back so much. After arrival I was searching for host for almost 2 hours, but it was Sunday and everyone was out. Decided just to wander around and wait.</p>
                <p>It was like 36 degrees, so a bit suffering weather.. Found a proposition in hang out to go to the beach. Why not?</p>
                <p>And again the luck was on my side: Nikolas proposed me to stay at his place.</p>
                <p>"..After a couple of hours on the beach in wonderful group of couchsurfers and friends of Nikolas I was asked if I'm sure to leave tomorrow (as I had a bus ticket).. Sooo.. I changed it! And stayed in Rome 2 days longer).."</p>
                <p>"..It was so special experience, hope to come back.." </p>
                <p align="center"><b>(from my reference to Niko)</b></p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="months">Naples</h3>
                <p class="drop-cap">Before coming to the city I got a couple of propositions and one of them was from Salman, so in a bus I texted him and got a positive answer. I came late evening, met a group of CSs and despite tiredness was really active. At Salman's place we were talking till 4 a.m. and I fell asleep without even noticed it.</p>
                <p>My rest wasn't long as the early bird catches the worm. Then was train to Pompei, met CSurfer from evening meeting, spent 3 hours and 19 euros there, went to Sorento, swam and jumped from cliffs, back to Naples, shower and night out which ended for me sleeping 7 mins on a bus bench waiting for the bus to Salman's place.</p>
                <p>Last full day in Italy was spend in archeological museum.</p>
                <p>The last think to mention: Naples is <b>PSYCHO</b>.</p>
