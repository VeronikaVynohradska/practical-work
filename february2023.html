            <p>I wanted to celebrate my 18th birthday in special way. Probably you've already got an idea that my way of enjoying life is travelling. My plan was to go to Amsterdam and invite my best boyfriend to join me. He lives in Germany and wasn't sure about being free on a selected dates.</p>
            <p>It was beginning of February when I was sitting in a kitchen with my mum discussing my birthday celebration, when my dad came in and told that it's a bad idea to go to Netherlands these days. I was upset and started searching a place in a town just to go with my family.</p>
            <p>But the next morning mum entered my room and asked if I wanna to go to Venice as my dad proposed. My answer was definitely YES! In a 3 days all neccessary preparations were done.</p>

                    <p>As a person on a low-budget, the accomodation in Venice booked not 2-3 months in advance is very expensive, decided to save money on transport and chose a night bus.</p>
                    <p>For you to understand the picture clearly: from bus station in my town to Paris it takes 3-3,5 hours, then from Paris to Venice - 16,5! So we (me and my mum) left home at 9 a.m. and arrived to Venice at 10 a.m. next day.</p>
                    <p>It's difficult for me, for my mum - tooo much, even through the fact that I slept 1-2 hours and she - twice more.</p>

                    <h3 class="months">Venice</h3>
                    <p>This city looks like from other universe! From my previous experience, felt like amazing mix of Italian vibe and Stockholm, because of water everywhere. As the city is quite small there are no ordinary public transport (you won't find cars, buses, trams etc.), to get from train station to another part you can take <i>vaporetto</i> - it looks like bus in the morning of a weekday in Kharkiv - always overcrowded water transport.</p>
                    <p>Even being too tired we couldn't miss any second and started exploring from the first minute. Even more - the next morning I ocasionally woke up at 6:30 a.m. and before university studies (yes, travels isn't a reason to be absent) took a walk. Venice seems to be awake 24/7!</p>
                    <p>On my birthday I was impressed as my mum went somewhere and came back with a very beautiful bouquet of roses which unfortunately couldn't be taken back home.</p>

            <h3 class="months">Bolonia</h3>
                <p>Me won't be me without crazy decisions. The next morning after my birthday we woke up at 5:30 a.m. to cover one more city during the trip. In Bolonia Vodafone tricked me up: my mobile data wasn't working for the whole day!</p>
                <p>During the day visited a couple of museums, walked through the city to feel the atmosphere and finished with a glass of aperol, plate of seafood on a market.</p>
